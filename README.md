# My Full-Stack Application

This application showcases my skills in Python and JavaScript by building a full-stack application from frontend to backend. Here are the technologies included:

## Frontend
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that makes styling components easier.
  
## Backend
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.
  
## Authentication and Cloud Services
- **AWS Cognito**: Provides authentication, authorization, and user management.
- **AWS S3**: A scalable object storage service for storing and retrieving files.

Feel free to explore the code and see how I've integrated these technologies! ðŸ˜Š
